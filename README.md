# CLI GAME ENGINE
- cli 
- ncurses
- ECS

## Requirements
- Linux

In most distro `Ncurses` is installed by default, otherwise you need to install the library.

## Compiling flags

The main flags are:
- ncurses: `-lncurses`
- In some cases the ncurses library is split in this other library: `-ltinfo` (use this flag if the compiler give an error on undefined reference to `stdscr`)
- form?


```shell

```
