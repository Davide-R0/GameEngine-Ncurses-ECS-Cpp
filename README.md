# CLI GAME ENGINE

> **_NOTE:_** Project for personal educational purposes.

- CLI application 
- Ncurses library
- ECS: Entity, Component, Systems
- Makefile [^1]
- Game engine is not separate from the core application's function [^2]

[^1]: In future CMake.
[^2]: A scopo didattico.

## Requirements
- Linux

In most distro `Ncurses` is installed by default, otherwise you need to install the library.

> **_NOTE:_** Note on log file:
> - it is raccomanded to open the log file with therminal program like `less`, `cat`, etc...
> - in `.bashrc`, or `.zshrc`, or whatever you have, add `export CLICOLOR=TRUE` if colors are not displayed.

## Compiling

### Flags 
The main flags are:
- Ncurses: `-lncurses`
    - For wide character: `-lncursesw`
- In some cases the ncurses library is split in this other library: `-ltinfo` (use this flag if the compiler give an error on undefined reference to `stdscr`)
    - For wide character: `-ltinfow`
- form?
- Debugging: `-g`, `-Wall`


## ECS

### Conventions:
- before component class name `C..`, es: `CSprite`, `CBox`, ...
- before component instatiation of class `c...`, es: `cSprite`, ...
- this two roule are the same with systems with `s`
- private member variable have `m_...`, es: `m_cSprite`, ...
- variable and function name use maiusc character as delimiter: es: `gameEngine`, `modGravityExp`, `veryLongVariable` ...

### General:
- Components: store only pure data, no logic
- Systems are function or classes
- Systems operate on entities that have some precise component


### Systems order in game loop:
1. Input
2. Movement
3. Physics
4. AI
5. Renderer

# TODO
1. ~~Multi scene managment~~
2. ~~Action managment~~
3. ~~Game loop~~
4. Add assertion
5. Add custom memory allocator
6. ~~Assets managment~~
7. ~~Riorganizzare l'ordine nelle cartelle del progetto~~
8. Ricontrollare le incluzioni negli header file
9. ~~Cambiare il vettore di shared pointer di entity in altro (vettore di puntatori normali?)~~
10. ~~Implementare la rimozione delle entit√† nell'entity manager~~
11. ~~Add wide character compatibility for ncurses~~
12. Implementare la prima scena di un menu
13. implementare la scena di gioco
14. Implementare la logica di gioco
15. Implementare la scena pausa
16. spostare tutte le definizioni degli enum nei corrispettivi header file ???
17. ~~rinominare la classe `scenaBase` in `scene`~~

# Future Optimizations
- custom memory allocator, array?, vector, math, phisics library
- all the systems
- implements grapics api 
- separare il core engine dai sistemi e dal source code del gioco
- 

# TO ADD in future 
- a way to verify that for each constructor called is being also called the destructor, usefull??
- Collisiion detection with a grid of detection (for close distance collision) like in the particle simulations programs
- for each entity, texture, world map, landscape, animations, lightining, sounds, particle system, AI systems, ..., objects create a fictitious preview (fast to render) to fast test this object while they are being constructed (coded)
- Separete the game engime static code from the compilation code of the game
- math and physiscs library
- documentations (online, pdf, linux manpage, windows??, AI chatbot?)
- Vulkan API, wayland? X11? 
- tools nvim (vscode?) plugin



# Writing Convenctions:
- sructs name: small letters with maiusc letter to separate 
- enum name, enum value: maiusc name with `_` as space 
- function: small letters with Maiusc as separator
- private data member start with `m_` and `s_` for static
